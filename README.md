# Zener-Drive
A pedal distortion designed for Bass Synths and Guitars. 


Pretty simple Drive Pedal initially desinged because i didn't liked how the one from my bass station sounded. 
A demo can be viewed here:

You're welcome to build one for yourself. If you're not a builder and only a player, hit me up, maybe we can arrange something.
